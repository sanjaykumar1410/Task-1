1. What is normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.

Example: Splitting customer details and order details into separate tables to avoid repetition.

Forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF.
--------
2. Explain primary vs foreign key.

Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table (e.g., StudentID in a Students table).

Foreign Key: A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, used to establish relationships.
--------
3. What are constraints?
Rules applied to columns in a table to maintain integrity and accuracy of data.

Types: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT.
---------
4. What is a surrogate key?
A system-generated key (often an auto-increment integer) used as a primary key instead of using natural keys like email or SSN.

Example: CustomerID INT AUTO_INCREMENT.
---------
5. How do you avoid data redundancy?

Apply normalization (splitting data into smaller, related tables).

Use primary–foreign key relationships.

Apply constraints to ensure consistency.
---------
6. What is an ER diagram?
An Entity-Relationship diagram is a visual model that shows entities (tables), their attributes (columns), and the relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N) between them.
---------
7. What are the types of relationships in DBMS?

One-to-One (1:1) → Each record in Table A relates to only one in Table B.

One-to-Many (1:N) → A single record in Table A can relate to many in Table B.

Many-to-Many (M:N) → Records in both tables can have multiple associations (implemented via a junction table).
---------
8. Explain the purpose of AUTO_INCREMENT.
AUTO_INCREMENT automatically generates a unique number for a column (usually primary key) whenever a new record is inserted.
---------
9. What is the default storage engine in MySQL?

InnoDB (since MySQL 5.5).

Supports ACID transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys.
---------
10. What is a composite key?
A primary key made up of two or more columns. Used when no single column can uniquely identify a row.

Example: (StudentID, CourseID) in an Enrollments table.-------
